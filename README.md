This is the source to a CSS text effects builder at

https://apps.josh.earth/cssbuilder/


* react app, client side state only
* type in the sample text, choose the color, font, size, weight, shadows, etc.
* choose from a list of presets that I steal from other sites
* each gives you the generated CSS and or a bitmap spritesheet
* some buttons to generate random
* all state in the URL, get people to trade them and send them to me
* what font selection? just what’s in your browser for now. later look into google fonts
* base text color, bg color, shadow color, shadow size and angle
* get a common react color picker that doesn’t suck
* an evolve button that takes what you have and generates 16 variations to choose from, then repeat the process. not all properties are evolved.
* history in the browser url stack
